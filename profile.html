            <p>My name is Alicia Brideau and I am an artist and graphic designer originally from Fredericton, New Brunswick and now I live in the great city of Ottawa.  I love everything different, funky and edgy and I want to use my skills to help other small business owners express their visions in real life.

                Art is my wheelhouse. Ever since I was little, I was drawing on desks, painting on the wall and doodling all over my hands. Art is the way I express myself; It brings me a sense of comfort like nothing else. Now that I’m older I grew out of drawing on the walls and my hands… SIKE! Now I just do it bigger, and better and louder then ever before! I have painted murals for Art Clubs at the Fredericton High school, I’ve designed and printed tape designs to bring life back into Cafeterias, I’ve even hosted and planned an Art House Café and raised over 500$ for underfunded Art Programs in N.B. If you are looking for something different, something big and out there. You have come to the right place!
