# **My Portfolio** 

## This portfolio was made to showcase my art and skills. It was made the intention to be both for clients and businesses.I wanted to embrace who I am wuth the pastel pinks but also kept it neural with the cooffee browns and transparent whites. I also want it to be known that my style of work is not ginaric, thats why there is fun shapped images and floating navigation! 

## One of the biggest struggles in making my portfolio was the navigation. I know for most that might be easy but my brain gets very loat in remendering what each position is meant to do and how it can be carried on through child-parent relations. I finally got to a point where I understood that if I wanted my nav bar to float it needed to be in a fixed position and everything else either had to be flex, relative etc. I'm honestly so proud with what I acomplished it's by far the best website i've made so far!

## Something else I learned while working on this project is that *I LOVE GRIDS!* It is so easy to format simple html pages with grids. It was deffinitly a life saver for this assignment.
